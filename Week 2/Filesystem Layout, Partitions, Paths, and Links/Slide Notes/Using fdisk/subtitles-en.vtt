00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.215
Let's get some experience working with fdisk

2
00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:09.470
and examining and modifying partitions on a Fedora 25 virtual machine.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.490
This machine has a 40 gigabyte disk, of which only 20 gigabytes are being used,

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.755
so let's run "fdisk /dev/sda".

5
00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.580
You'll notice I am logged in as root here, instead of a normal user,

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.220
it'll make our life much easier.

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.090
If I type "m" for help,

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.360
I will see all the possible commands,

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.100
but it's a rather long list,

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.295
I encourage you to look at.

11
00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:35.940
But let's just experiment with some of them.

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.055
So, "p" means print and it's showing me I have

13
00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:45.639
a 40 gigabyte disk, as I said, of which there's 19G in a Linux partition.

14
00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.100
So, the files on the system are all in one big partition,

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.790
nothing fancy, and there's a one gigabyte swap partition.

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.190
So, let's say I want to create a new one,

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.079
I type "n" for new, and I'll make it a primary partition,

18
00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.575
and I'll take the default number of 3,

19
00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.780
and for the first sector,

20
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.640
I'll just take the default,

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.550
which is to start right after the second partition.

22
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.350
I could give the last sector to give the size, that's a little bit complicated,

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.420
but I can also specify the size in gigabytes.

24
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.750
So, say "+5G" and it's telling me it's

25
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.240
making a partition of 3 of type Linux and of 5GiB.

26
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.840
If I want to modify the type,

27
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.780
I would type lowercase "t" for type,

28
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.390
and let's say I say partition 3.

29
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.290
But then I have to know the actual index codes.

30
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.890
So, if I type capital "L",

31
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.565
it tells me all the different possible partitions I can set up.

32
00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:56.750
In many cases, it really doesn't matter what you

33
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.019
put in the system. Once you format the partition,

34
00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.960
the system will just look at it anyway.

35
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.930
But you see here's 83 as a standard Linux partition,

36
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.955
so I'll just leave it at that with 83,

37
00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:11.980
and "p" is just a normal partition.

38
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.305
I have to write out the partition scheme with "w", and that worked,

39
00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:23.305
but you notice the system says it may have some trouble using this partition,

40
00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:27.095
unless I reboot or run "partprobe" or "kpartx".

41
00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:31.250
So, let's run "partprobe" for partition probe "-s",

42
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.769
and it's telling me it's sort of 3 partitions and we do "fdisk",

43
00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.440
"-l /dev/sda", and that's fine.

44
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.550
If I want, I can put a filesystem on

45
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:53.835
that partition with "mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3".

46
00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:57.945
I think I said it had a filesystem on it just from previous

47
00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:00.135
work that I did. It really didn't.

48
00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:03.090
So, it's a relic of the past.

49
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.585
So, that's how I would do things from the command line.

50
00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:10.280
There's a graphical utility called "gparted" that you

51
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.540
can find for almost all distributions,

52
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.365
though it often doesn't come in the default set of packages.

53
00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:23.960
So, let me run "gparted" and that gives you a graphical display of what's going on.

54
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.240
So, you can see here's my first partition,

55
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.340
and then here's my swap partition,

56
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.540
and then here's the new partition that I made,

57
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.900
so let's make that bigger.

58
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.930
So, you can do a number of things with "gparted".

59
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.210
First, let me make another partition,

60
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.215
so here I go to my allocated space there and then I click on Partition, I say New,

61
00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:49.425
and I can control all this graphically,

62
00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:54.320
so I'll make it that's about eight gigabytes or so,

63
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.280
and I'll just say add, and I can control the type of filesystem,

64
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.040
I can give a name, and a label,

65
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.640
but I won't do any of that now,

66
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.110
and then when I actually click on the arrow up here,

67
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.254
the changes will be applied.

68
00:04:08.254 --> 00:04:13.610
It's always going to warn you when you try to make a change in the partition table,

69
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.625
that it's kind of a potentially dangerous operation.

70
00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.420
Now, there's other things I can do here,

71
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.230
this is where the graphical utilities are

72
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.250
useful, because these things are hard to do from the command line.

73
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.710
Suppose I click on the new one I just made,

74
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.735
you notice I still have space after that partition,

75
00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:39.940
I can click on partition and then I can go resize and move and I can move it,

76
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.970
so I say to the end of the hard disk.

77
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.745
I can click on check mark, save,

78
00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:53.750
yes and this would be slow if

79
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.690
the partition actually contains some data, because it has to copy everything over,

80
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.185
but since it's pretty empty,

81
00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:02.900
the utility is smart enough to do it quickly,

82
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.640
I can also do things like I can change the size,

83
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.530
so let me look at this partition 3 we made at the command line,

84
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.350
and I'll do the resize and move it.

85
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.520
Last time, I just moved it.

86
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.890
This time let me make it bigger,

87
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:26.430
that has worked just fine.

88
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.765
You can look at the details if you want,

89
00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:31.210
telling you everything that it did.

90
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.370
It had to check the filesystem for errors,

91
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.385
increase the partition first,

92
00:05:36.385 --> 00:05:39.100
and then grow the filesystem to fill the partition,

93
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.510
and then it does some other checks, etc.

94
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:49.980
So, that's some basic experience in how to manipulate partition tables on a basic system.
