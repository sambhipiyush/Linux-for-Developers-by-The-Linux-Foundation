00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.045
We will now demonstrate graphical tools for

2
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:11.265
package management on openSUSE with the GNOME interface.

3
00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:15.260
The basic tool for doing this is called YaST, Y-A-S-T,

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.915
which stands for Yet Another Setup Tool,

5
00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:20.805
and it's available in all SUSE-based systems.

6
00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:25.605
So, if I click in the upper right here, and then I click on Settings,

7
00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.100
you'll see at the very bottom,

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.800
it's a little hard to see, but you'll see the YaST icon.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.315
Of course, it wants me to have root privilege.

10
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:37.010
So, I'll type in the root password.

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.350
Then, YaST does much more than control package management,

12
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.250
it's your basic interface for all system administration.

13
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.220
But let's scroll down to the System and look for Software.

14
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.990
It's right at the top, Software Management.

15
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.270
So first, it has to synchronize all its repository information,

16
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.675
to be sure it's up to date.

17
00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:25.425
Then, I get the basic interface here.

18
00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:27.330
It's waiting for me to search,

19
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.415
so I could search something like gcc.

20
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:34.775
It will show me all packages that have gcc in their name.

21
00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:40.155
But let's go over to Package Group, because that is the easiest way to interface.

22
00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:43.070
Then, I can go click on any particular thing,

23
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.630
suppose I click on the GNOME Desktop,

24
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.895
it gives me a list of packages that are installed.

25
00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:51.620
Okay. So, notice what would happen if I click on

26
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.000
NetworkManager-gnome and I just click on it one time.

27
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.410
It may be hard to see,

28
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.775
but I'll put a little up arrow there.

29
00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:02.515
If I say, "Accept",

30
00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:05.520
it's going to re-install this package.

31
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.835
It already was installed,

32
00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:09.590
so that was unnecessary.

33
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.750
But if you think there's a problem,

34
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.895
then that's a good thing to do.

35
00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:18.085
Now, let's get back into Software Management again.

36
00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:20.520
So, it's re-synchronizing.

37
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.040
If I go back to Package Groups and I'll get back into GNOME again.

38
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.290
Then now, if I click on it twice.

39
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.860
Okay. Now, that would be to remove,

40
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.870
which is not a very wise idea here because it's a very basic package that's

41
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.390
going to remove a bunch of other things that I do not want to remove,

42
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.640
so I won't do that.

43
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.715
So, that's a brief look at

44
00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:56.190
the Package Manager capabilities that are embedded in YaST on SUSE systems.
