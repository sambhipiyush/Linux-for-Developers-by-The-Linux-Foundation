00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.670
We're now going to show you what a KDE desktop would look like running on CentOS 7.

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.730
Most people running CentOS are using the GNOME desktop,

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.330
but we'll show you what it looks like for KDE,

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.240
and it would not look that much different on other distributions,

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.505
just like the GNOME desktop doesn't look very different on other distributions.

6
00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:30.005
So, here I have a GNOME desktop running and I'm going to install KDE on here.

7
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:38.560
So, the easiest way to do that is with "sudo yum install KDE".

8
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.640
Oh, I'm sorry, it's "groupinstall" [sudo yum groupinstall KDE].

9
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.180
Okay. You'll see there is quite a bit of stuff,

10
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.270
92 megabyte download with 274 megabytes of installed size,

11
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.920
but it goes pretty quickly.

12
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.290
Then, what I will have to do once this is finished installing, is log

13
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.860
out of the GNOME desktop and then log into the KDE desktop,

14
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.830
and then we'll play around a little bit, to see what's going on.

15
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.845
It's done with its installation essentially,

16
00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:25.960
doing a little bit of setup and verification.

17
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.160
Fine. So, let's log out.

18
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.230
So, I go to the upper right corner,

19
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.100
I click on "student" and log out.

20
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.720
I'm still using the GDM login screen,

21
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.900
rather than the KDM, but that doesn't really matter for showing the desktop itself.

22
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.930
So I say, I give my password,

23
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.675
and then, here, next to the "Sign in",

24
00:01:53.675 --> 00:02:00.080
there's a gear wheel where I can pick which I want to use, which desktop.

25
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.030
So, I'm picking KDE Plasma Workspace, and I sign in.

26
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.580
This is what a totally unconfigured,

27
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.175
basically, KDE desktop, would look like.

28
00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:17.580
So, it is taking a little bit to start up,

29
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.675
a little bit of time because it's the first time we've run the KDE desktop.

30
00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:26.620
If I click on the lower left corner here,

31
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.075
I get to see a number of basic menus that I can go to.

32
00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:36.200
If I go to "Applications",

33
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:44.920
you see them organized by different qualities, under "Utilities", for instance.

34
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.135
I can see "Text Editor",

35
00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.680
all sorts of things.

36
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.790
If I wanted to run, for instance,

37
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.780
a terminal window, I can right click on the desktop and pick Konsole,

38
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.385
and, by default, the fonts are a little bit not

39
00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:12.660
very bright, but then I can just go ahead and configure to my heart's content.

40
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.390
If I look down on the lower right here, there's a calendar and the time,

41
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.180
if I click on that, I get a whole calendar.

42
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.880
Next to that, I get information about my networking,

43
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.610
the sound, here, okay, and I can control various things,

44
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.095
and here's the settings.

45
00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:33.860
That's a clipboard, I'm sorry,

46
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.390
where I can cut and paste things into.

47
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.275
If I want to log out,

48
00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:46.840
I go down to the icon on the lower left here, and then I just go to "Leave".

49
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.790
Then, here I can pick on "Log out" or "Shut down", let's say.

50
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.860
So, let's go all the way to the "Shut down",

51
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.450
and I'll turn off the computer.

52
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.295
Okay. So, that's what I wanted to show.

53
00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:09.280
KDE and GNOME on CentOS.
