00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.330
We'll now get some practice using the low-level rpm command

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.250
in order to look at a package, try to remove it, etc.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.190
So, we're going to type "rpm -qa" for query, and look at all packages on the system.

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.830
And then we're going to grep to look for the package bzip2, okay?

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.830
And you see there's actually two rpm packages which have bzip2 in their names.

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.060
The actual bzip2 program and

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.040
then bzip2-libs, which is libraries that depend on bzip2.

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.212
So, let's take a look more at information about bzip2,

9
00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:48.737
if I do rpm, if I do do "rpm -q" for query, "i" for information.

10
00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:55.399
And then "l" for list of files, and that's a lot, so I'll pipe it through "less".

11
00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.773
Oops, I forgot to give the name of the packag, so bzip2 [rpm -qil bzip2 | less].

12
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.760
You see the name is bzib2, you see it's version 1.0.6.

13
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.459
We see it's source rpm [src.rpm] here, we see when it was

14
00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:17.531
released, in November 2015 at centos.org,

15
00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:21.740
and then a description of what it does.

16
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.080
It's a freely available, patent-free, high quality, data compressor, etc.

17
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.898
And then a list of the files that are part of bzip2.

18
00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:37.358
If I want to get a little bit more detailed look at what's in there,

19
00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:43.363
I could do something a little fancier, like "rpm -ql bzip2".

20
00:01:43.363 --> 00:01:45.610
We just list the files.

21
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.240
And then, I'll make that a shell command and substitute forward, and

22
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.040
do an "ls -lF" on that [ls -lF $(rpm -ql bzip2)].

23
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.250
So this would give me a detailed listing.

24
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.550
And then, I'll pipe it into less, and these are the actual files that are in

25
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.080
the package in a little bit more detail, like their length and what type of files.

26
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.880
You’ll notice where it says bunzip2 and bzip2 are really the same file.

27
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.972
It’s just a symbolic link and the system knows what to do or

28
00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:19.231
I should say the application knows what to do, whether to zip or

29
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.922
unzip, depending on how it’s called.

30
00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:28.690
Now, let's see what happens if I try to remove the package.

31
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.380
So, I should be a root to do this, so

32
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.370
I'll do an "sudo", and then I'll do an "rpm -e" for erase.

33
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.260
And then, just to be extra careful, I'll use the "--test", which means it won't

34
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.950
actually do anything with this option, it'll just see if it could do it, "bzip2" [sudo rpm -e --test bzip2].

35
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.440
So I try to remove it, and it's telling me that

36
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.020
I can't do that because it's needed by those following three packages,

37
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.840
as well as the file-roller program, which is

38
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.800
an archiving program present on basically all Linux distributions.

39
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.573
And then, I can get a little more information in a different way with "rpm -q

40
00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:17.050
--whatprovides bzip2",

41
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.120
and you'll see it's the bzip2 package.

42
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.797
And if I do "whatrequires" [rpm -q --whatrequires bzip2],

43
00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:34.949
I get the same information about the three packages that would need

44
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:41.010
to have bzip2 installed for them to behave properly and not crash or anything.

45
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.853
A little bit later, we’re going to discuss yum and zypper and also dnf,

46
00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:52.130
which are higher level programs that can handle dependencies in a robust fashion.

47
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.420
rpm is really designed for individual packages which

48
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.500
are listed on the command line or groups of packages listed on the command line.
