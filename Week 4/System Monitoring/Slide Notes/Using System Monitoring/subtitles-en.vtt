00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's get a brief look at a few of

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.215
the system monitoring tools that are available on your system.

3
00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.195
In the left-hand window here,

4
00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:11.565
I'm running gnome-system-monitor,

5
00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:17.100
which gives me a graphical picture of CPU history on top,

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.855
with one line for each CPU on the system.

7
00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:22.890
This is a system with four cores,

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.840
each one of which is hyperthreaded so,

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.775
it appears as eight CPUs.

10
00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:31.795
In the second line we're seeing memory and swap history.

11
00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:37.050
So, here's the memory usage in this circular graph here and swap here.

12
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.930
Then the third, we're looking at network history,

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.400
we're seeing both sending and receiving.

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.975
So, in the window on the top right,

15
00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:47.720
I'm going to run top which gives

16
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.675
basic process monitoring on my system and in the bottom window,

17
00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.630
I'm going to run vmstat,

18
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.960
with a command of a to show everything and then,

19
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.390
I'm going to run it every two seconds,

20
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.550
a thousand times, just so it doesn't stop.

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330
Then in the lower right here,

22
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.675
I'm going to run a very CPU intensive task,

23
00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:13.310
which is a kernel compile,

24
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.680
which proceeds in parallel on each CPU.

25
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.145
So, it's very CPU intensive.

26
00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.590
So, let me do that.

27
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.805
So, that's running now.

28
00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:27.860
Then first of all, you'll quickly see that

29
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.320
the CPU usage is going to pin up at the top here.

30
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.225
It takes a few seconds to cut in but then it's going,

31
00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:38.845
all the CPUs are busy at the top here.

32
00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:42.604
Also, I can see that in the top output

33
00:01:42.604 --> 00:01:47.635
the system is using 80 percent of its CPU time roughly,

34
00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:49.240
on user processes,

35
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.885
that means compiling and the user space,

36
00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:55.070
and about 10 percent during system activity which is

37
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.200
going to be handling system calls for the most part.

38
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.420
If I hit the number one,

39
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.250
I can get a readout for each CPU,

40
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.870
instead of just the sum totals,

41
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.780
which we now see on the top,

42
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.715
you see they're all quite busy.

43
00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:14.420
On the bottom here, we can see all the activity going on with the memory on the system.

44
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.890
In particular, how many pages are active and inactive,

45
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.270
swaps coming in and out,

46
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.415
how much space is free, et cetera.

47
00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:26.600
So, that's just a brief look at a few of the tools that are available on your system.
