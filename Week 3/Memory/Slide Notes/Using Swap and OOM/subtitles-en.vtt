00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
So, let's examine how our system uses swap, and then we'll also

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.665
investigate how the Out of Memory killer, or OOM killer, can be invoked.

3
00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:16.250
This is on a Fedora 25 virtual machine.

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.370
So, you can see I have running on the left here a GNOME system monitor,

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.725
and the middle graph here is the one we're interested in, is about memory.

6
00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:31.819
Not much is happening, of course, and it says I have 3.8 gigabytes,

7
00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:37.175
I'm using 1.4. And then, it says of my swap I have a gigabyte here,

8
00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:40.155
but I'm using zero of it.

9
00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:45.635
So, I can get the same information here by saying "free -m",

10
00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:47.790
and it's telling me the same,

11
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.035
I have a total of 3932 megabytes,

12
00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:56.115
and I have 1019 in swap, of which 0 is being used.

13
00:00:56.115 --> 00:01:03.400
Now, we have a little program here called "wastemem", which I should compile.

14
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.200
All this program does is it adds memory

15
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.960
one megabyte at a time up to a number given as an argument,

16
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.890
and then it waits 5 seconds, and then releases the memory.

17
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.955
So, it's just a way to tie up your memory.

18
00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:27.215
So, let me run wastemem,

19
00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:32.880
and I have less than 3 gigabytes free,

20
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.420
so let me ask for 3,000 megabytes.

21
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.550
Then, you see on the left here, it's adding one at a time,

22
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.290
and in the graph in the middle here, on the GNOME system memory,

23
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.565
the memory usage is going up.

24
00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:51.045
When it uses all available memory,

25
00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:54.320
it will start to use swap, and that's indeed what happened.

26
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.900
I wind up using about 400 megabytes of swap.

27
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.480
So, that's what I expected.

28
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.155
Now, I've released memory, so the memory usage is going down,

29
00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:04.960
so that's all as expected.

30
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.720
But, let's see what happens if I turn off swap, and that's easy with

31
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.590
the command "sudo swapoff -a",

32
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.905
that will turn off all swap,

33
00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:19.660
partitions and swap files on the system.

34
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.150
You can see over here, in the system monitor, it's gradually reducing the amount of swap.

35
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.040
It takes a little bit of time because it has to copy over

36
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.255
things from the swap area back into resident memory.

37
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.495
So, the memory use will go up a little bit,

38
00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:39.220
and so it's almost done.

39
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.810
So now, I have no swap on the system.

40
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.030
That means if I try to ask for 3 gigabytes again,

41
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.090
it is not available and I can't spill over into swaps.

42
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.800
Let's try that again and see what happens.

43
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.910
You see now at 2617 is getting hung up, and everything disappeared.

44
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.120
So, what happened? The Out of Memory killer was invoked.

45
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.560
So, let's open up a terminal and try to see what happened here a little bit.

46
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.675
I'll just use a blue background, and I'll get a bigger font.

47
00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:22.630
Well, I could investigate in detail, but let me just type "dmesg" and get kernel messages.

48
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.250
Let me make that bigger.

49
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.605
There's a long set of output before that. It runs through everything on the system,

50
00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:37.030
it reports its so-called OOM score,

51
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.880
what the priority is,

52
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.900
with killing the thing, but you see here, out of memory.

53
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.410
It killed wastemem, that was the guilty party.

54
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.500
It was using all the memory and not doing anything useful.

55
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.620
It killed that, but it also killed the shell that was running in, as

56
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.310
well as the GNOME system monitor, which is being run in the same shell.

57
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.575
But now the system is healthy and running okay.

58
00:03:58.575 --> 00:04:01.760
So, that's a demonstration of the use of swap, as well as

59
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.640
the functionality of the Out of Memory killer.
