00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.219
We're now going to show a very simple use of the user device, or udev system,

2
00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.590
which makes sure that the system recognizes any new devices which are plugged in,

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.790
and also recognizes when they're removed.

4
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.690
For this we're going to use a simple USB key.

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.440
So, in one window on my desktop we're going to

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.535
just monitor kernel messages by typing "dmesg".

7
00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:32.800
We'll give it the "-w" option [dmesg -w], which means continuously update as new messages come in.

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.180
So, I'm going to hit return a few times, just to

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.040
separate out the new input from what was already there.

10
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.705
In my other window, I'm going to see what's there in my device for hard disk nodes.

11
00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:55.100
You'll see I have a number of partitions in /sda,

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.290
which is an SSD, and /sdb,

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.765
which is a USB disk that's already inserted.

14
00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:11.710
So now I'm going to plug in to a USB port a USB key,

15
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.570
and you see on the left, in

16
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.265
the dmesg window, it recognized there was a mass storage device.

17
00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:22.470
A SCSI removable disk.

18
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.630
If I look over here,

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.005
I see "ls -l /dev/sd*" again.

20
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:33.240
And now we'll see these new entries here,

21
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690
/sdc, and /sdc1, and /sdc2.

22
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.380
That means there's two partitions on the new disk.

23
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.390
If I open with files down here,

24
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.845
we'll see that this is actually a Red Hat 7 install disk.

25
00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:52.505
Okay, so that's actually what's on the USB stick.

26
00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:59.430
Then, I should unmount it before I remove it.

27
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.620
But since I haven't done anything, I'll be sloppy,

28
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.720
and I'll just pull it out.

29
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.480
And you see the new messages appeared on the left saying "USB disconnect".

30
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.215
And if I look again at what devices are actually there in the device directory,

31
00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:21.135
you'll see it's gone again.

32
00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:23.210
So, that's a simple demonstration of

33
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.780
how your system notices when new devices are plugged in,

34
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.490
loads the necessary drivers,

35
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.610
and makes them available.
