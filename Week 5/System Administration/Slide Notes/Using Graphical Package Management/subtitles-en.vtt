00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.230
In our discussion of package management systems,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.355
we will be concentrating on using the command line.

3
00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:12.535
However, all Linux distributions have at least one graphical interface.

4
00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:16.890
One graphical interface is known as gnome-software,

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.730
and is available on any distribution that is running with a GNOME desktop.

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.840
So, first thing we need to do,

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.780
is to make sure that it's actually installed on our system.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.240
So, I'll do "which gnome-software",

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.000
and it is not installed on the system.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.825
So, I'll do "sudo yum install gnome-software",

11
00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:45.380
using the yum command,

12
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.265
which we will discuss in great detail later.

13
00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:50.780
It's only going to be a couple of megabytes.

14
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.490
So, we install that,

15
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.585
and now I'll launch it from the command line.

16
00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:58.260
Just type in "gnome-software".

17
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.630
Notice, I'm running this as a normal user,

18
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.000
if it needs to actually install or remove something,

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.520
it will ask me for the password.

20
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.425
So, as it comes up,

21
00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:17.495
it looks pretty much like an app store or Gnome Play Store,

22
00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.810
where it shows by groupings,

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.040
by Category, the different things that are available.

24
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.800
So, for instance, if I were to click on System,

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.700
you'll see I have Featured,

26
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.990
I have File Manager,

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.710
I have File System,

28
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.975
File tools, et cetera, monitoring security.

29
00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:37.900
So let's say, I were to go on Terminal Emulator.

30
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.250
Okay. I do not have XTerm installed on my system.

31
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.540
That's a very old-fashioned terminal program.

32
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.980
So, for Fran, it does say installed, actually, underneath it.

33
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.855
But here is an even more ancient one, X3270.

34
00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:58.460
So, let's see what happens if I click on it,

35
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.964
it's asking me if I want to install it, and for that, it wants my password.

36
00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:08.120
This is the root password on a Red Hat system,

37
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.610
this is CentOS 7.

38
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.380
So, it's now installed and I could launch it here if I wanted to see what it does,

39
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.860
but I'll dispense with that.

40
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.475
Let me remove it because I don't really need it.

41
00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:21.575
So, now it's removed.

42
00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:25.020
Once again it's asking me for my password.

43
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.460
Okay, and it's done.

44
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.440
And then let's go back to the main menu.

45
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.625
If I click on Installed applications,

46
00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.595
I can pick on one, say,

47
00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:44.455
Cheese, which is a program for taking your picture or a video of yourself.

48
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:47.090
It's good for testing your webcam.

49
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.510
So, let's say I want to remove that,

50
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.955
I'll say yes I want to remove it.

51
00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:55.570
And notice it didn't ask me for the password again.

52
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.810
Well, let's put it back because I'd kind of like to have it.

53
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.460
So, I'll click Install,

54
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.440
and now it's installed again.

55
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.220
So, in the succeeding sections,

56
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.510
we will now discuss the command line interfaces beginning with the lower level commands

57
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.495
like rpm and dpkg and then, continuing with the higher level commands like yum,

58
00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:25.740
dnf, zypper and apt-get. Thank you.
