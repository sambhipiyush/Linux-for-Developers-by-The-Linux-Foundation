00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.998
Let's get some practice with the basic low-level command for

2
00:00:05.998 --> 00:00:11.326
the Debian packaging system, dpkg, or d-package.

3
00:00:11.326 --> 00:00:14.747
So, to get a list of all the packages on this system,

4
00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:19.035
I can simply type "dpkg --list".

5
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:24.960
And I'll just pipe that into "less", because it's a long list [dpkg --list | less].

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.202
Okay, actually, if I don't use "less", for some reason, it's more compact.

7
00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:36.400
Okay, so there are a lot of different packages on the system.

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.529
Now, if I want to see some information just about a particular package,

9
00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:47.199
I could just grep, let's say, bzip2 to see what's going on with bzip2 [dpkg --list | grep bzip2].

10
00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.156
And that's the information about bzip2 that tells us the version number,

11
00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:55.022
the architecture, which here is amd64,

12
00:00:55.022 --> 00:01:00.151
and it's description as a high quality block sorting file compressor utility.

13
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:05.963
So it's a more advanced program of better compression than gzip or

14
00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:08.362
the old fashion zip program.

15
00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:14.798
If I want to see what's actually contained in that package,

16
00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:20.236
I can do "dpkg --listfiles", and then the name of it [dpkg --listfiles bzip2].

17
00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:24.395
And then I'll go slower by putting into less [dpkg --listfiles bzip2 | less].

18
00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:28.163
And you see there is the executables in the /bin directory.

19
00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:31.609
And then what's under /user is basically documentation.

20
00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.738
Under /user/share/doc, /user/share/man, etc.

21
00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:40.419
If I try to remove the package,

22
00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:43.743
let's see what happens.

23
00:01:43.743 --> 00:01:46.843
So do "sudo dpkg" and, of course,

24
00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:52.175
I have to have root privilege to remove the package.

25
00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:57.529
So I'm removing bzip2, "sudo dpkg --remove bzip2".

26
00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:03.793
And it's telling me I cannot do this because I need the development package,

27
00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:06.975
dpkg-dev, that would be headers and

28
00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:11.663
stuff for programs which use this in a library version.

29
00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:16.043
And fire-roller, which is an archive extractor that's prominent on Linux

30
00:02:16.043 --> 00:02:19.292
systems, so I would have to remove all three of them.

31
00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:21.612
We'll see later when we use tools like apt-get,

32
00:02:21.612 --> 00:02:24.005
it's easier to deal with these dependencies.
