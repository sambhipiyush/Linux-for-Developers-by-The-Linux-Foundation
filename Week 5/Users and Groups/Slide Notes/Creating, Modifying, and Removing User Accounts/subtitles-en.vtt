00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.410
Let's get some experience with creating,

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.485
modifying and removing a new user account.

3
00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:10.945
We will do this on Ubuntu 17.04.

4
00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:17.085
There are some variations between distributions about what exactly is created,

5
00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:23.470
whether a new account is created and exactly which files are there, etc.

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.255
This is mostly controlled by a file under /etc/default/useradd appropriately named.

7
00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:33.210
So, you can see, for example,

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.390
in here, the default shell is set to be SHELL=/bin/sh.

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.265
Now, on some distributions, such as Red Hat, this file is rather

10
00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:47.815
short and not very well documented, on Ubuntu is rather long.

11
00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:53.170
So, let's create the account: "sudo useradd".

12
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.140
I'll say, "-m" to make sure it creates a home directory.

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.705
Some distributions do not do that by default.

14
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:04.270
Ubuntu does not,

15
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.665
for instance, and neither does openSUSE.

16
00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:12.480
I'll give the full name to be "Eric Dolphy".

17
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.425
I'll specify the default shell to be /bin/bash with the "-s" option,

18
00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:23.005
and here's the name edolphy [sudo useradd -m -c "Eric Dolphy" -s /bin/bash edolphy].

19
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.900
Now, I still have to pass assess via password.

20
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.500
So, I'll do that with "sudo passwd edolphy".

21
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.895
Then, I type something,

22
00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.710
and now the account exists.

23
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.480
I can verify that by making sure entries were made in

24
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.830
the /etc/passwd file and /etc/group [grep edolphy /etc/passwd /etc/group],

25
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.440
and there we go.

26
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.570
Notice it is now user 1001.

27
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.575
Remember, normal users start at 1,000, and student is user 1,000,

28
00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:03.095
and so that's appropriate.

29
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:08.755
Also, the other information I specified is there, such as the full username,

30
00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:11.165
and the shell /bin/bash,

31
00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:14.930
and the group is set to be 1001,

32
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.760
which is the same ID as the user.

33
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.055
All users are created with at least one group that has the same number as their username.

34
00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:26.900
Now, let's actually try to log into that account,

35
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.340
and I'll do that with "ssh edolphy@localhost".

36
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.259
I'll give the password,

37
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.730
and I succeeded just fine.

38
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.330
So, let's see what's actually in that directory.

39
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.180
You'll see there isn't much,

40
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.520
but these are files that all new users get.

41
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.970
Let me log out now.

42
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.210
That's controlled by whatever's in the /etc/skel directory,

43
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.050
anything you put in there.

44
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.075
Let me do the "-a" option [ls -la /etc/skel].

45
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:03.780
Anything you put in there,

46
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.720
will show up in any new user's account.

47
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.070
So, let's just clean up,

48
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.870
and I'll do that with "userdel -r edolphy".

49
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.525
The r is necessary to make sure it removes the home directory.

50
00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:31.520
You'll notice, I get a warning message about not having created a mail spool file,

51
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.405
that's harmless, and if I do "ls -l /home" now,

52
00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:37.175
we see the account has gone.

53
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.700
So, we're all cleaned up.
