#### Title: Text Editors

### Introduction to Text Editos

* Types of editors available
	1. vi - standard editor available on all UNIX-like systems
	1. vim-enhanced - same as vi but with many enhancements
	1. vim-X11 - vi with full graphical support
	1. emacs - standard editor available on all UNIX-like systems
	1. xemacs - varient of emacs, preferred by some
	1. nano - small and easy to use
	1. gedit - graphical editor part of GNOME desktop
	1. KWrite - graphical editor part of KDE desktop
	1. kate - graphical editor part of KDE desktop
	1. nedit - simple graphical editor

* vi and emacs
	1. They are always available on every Linux installation, though one will often not find emacs in a default installation
	1. vi and emacs, have a pure text-based form that runs perfectly well in a non-graphical environment
	1. They also have X-based graphical forms that would extend their capabilities

* nano
	1. Very easy to use and simple

* gedit and KWrite
	1. Both are easy to begin with, extremely capable and configurable

### vi Editor

* vi is short for view
* The actual name of the program was probably vim, to which vi has been the alias to as its substitute name
* vi --> pronounced as vee-eye
* There are two fundamental modes, and you toggle between each with the escape key
	1. command mode
	1. insert mode

* Both GNOME and KDE offer graphical interfaces for the vi text editor. 
* GNOME offers gvim, while KDE offers kvim.

### emacs Editor

* Emacs is available on all Linux systems, occasionally it's not installed by default
* It's one of the very first open source software projects, originally written by Richard Stallman who founded the Free Software Foundation, which gave rise to the new project
* Emacs has almost an infinite variety of capabilities beyond text editing, such as 
	1. email
	1. debugging
	1. constitutes a complete integrated development environment, etc
* There's only one mode in emacs, unlike the two modes in vi
* In order to do special control functions and issue commands relevant to the editor, you use either the ***Control (Ctrl) key*** or the ***META key***
* For the ***META key***, you can easily use either ***ALT*** or ***Escape*** in combination with other keys
