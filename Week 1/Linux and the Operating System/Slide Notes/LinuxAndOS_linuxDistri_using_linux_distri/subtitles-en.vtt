WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.020
All recent Gnome-based Linux distributions look rather similar as far as starting up,

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.155
logging in, and shutting down.

3
00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:18.705
So, we will briefly demonstrate that using VMware on Red Hat 7 host.

4
00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:23.295
So, let's begin with CentOS 7,

5
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.025
so let me bring up VMware,

6
00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.330
and I will pick CentOS 7.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.970
I'll just say, ''Power On,'' and you'll see first,

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.780
it's letting me pick between different kernels that

9
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.130
we have, both the stock kernel that comes with CentOS,

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.605
as well as custom kernels that have been compiled.

11
00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.640
Incidentally, the virtual machines that you see here,

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.290
are available on our website,

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.895
at least most of them,

14
00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:59.690
that you can download and use with

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.415
the instructions you received when you began the course.

16
00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:08.245
So, it takes about 10 or so seconds to get to the login screen,

17
00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:10.545
which will come up shortly.

18
00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:13.380
For succeeding virtual machines,

19
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.965
I will abbreviate this process,

20
00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:18.570
so you don't have to wait through all this.

21
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.170
There you go. So now,

22
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.650
I will log in with the "student" account.

23
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.000
So, it's logging in,

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.270
and we have selected a custom background here,

25
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.790
but other than that, it's pretty much the default appearance.

26
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.890
Then I can log out by clicking on the upper right corner,

27
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.980
and hitting the power button,

28
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:12.030
and saying ''Power Off,'' and then it'll shut off pretty efficiently.

29
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.680
So next, let us do Ubuntu 17.04.

30
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.935
Okay. It's warning me about some things being missing on the host,

31
00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:37.830
and if I wanted to,

32
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.005
in the GRUB screen,

33
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.135
hit "Return" on "Advanced Options",

34
00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:45.180
you see it'll let me picked a particular kernel,

35
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.320
this one is actually going to boot into a custom kernel that we compiled, 4.110,

36
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.040
or I can scroll down and get the Ubuntu stock kernel here,

37
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.620
which is 4.10.024 generic.

38
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.425
I hit "Return", and then boot.

39
00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:03.870
Now, let me hit "Pause",

40
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.510
so you don't have to see all this.

41
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.825
Now, I'm back at the login screen,

42
00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:14.850
I skipped a few seconds there.

43
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.469
The Ubuntu desktop still looks somewhat different than the other GNOME desktops,

44
00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.060
because it's still the Unity interface,

45
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.950
it's taking a few seconds to come up, there you go.

46
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.225
So, on the left, I have all my favorites listed, et cetera,

47
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:36.765
and then I can log out,

48
00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:41.390
once again by going to the Power button on the right.

49
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.850
Then it looks a little different,

50
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.880
but there's still a "Shutdown",

51
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.155
and then, I'll select "Shutdown" instead of "Restart".

52
00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:52.390
So, let me pause again.

53
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.640
Alright. So now, we're at the login screen,

54
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.580
and once again, it looks pretty similar.

55
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.340
It's asking for the password.

56
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.860
Once again, the login screen is remarkably the same,

57
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.110
the Power button is a standard GNOME power thing,

58
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.850
I click on that,

59
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.425
then I can click on "Power Off".

60
00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:55.830
So, you see, other than cosmetic differences,

61
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.520
they all pretty much the same when you start up.
