1
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.425
So far, we have done all our package management

2
00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:10.200
utilities et cetera, from the command line.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.015
But all distributions do include some graphical interface for package management.

4
00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.740
On recent Red Hat-based systems,

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.940
the yumex, for extended yum,

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.010
I guess, utility is designed for that purpose.

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.140
So, first, let's make sure that it's actually installed on the system. So, I can do

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.755
"which yumex". This is on a CentOS 7 system.

9
00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:38.475
It's not installed, so let's install it.

10
00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:43.600
So, "sudo yum install yumex".

11
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.240
It has to check repositories.

12
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.645
You see it did find it and it needs also some Python packages,

13
00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.425
and it found that in the EPEL repository,

14
00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.910
the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux,

15
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.185
which does not come with a base CentOS or Red Hat installation,

16
00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:16.280
but it comes from the Fedora people, and the EPEL repository works very well.

17
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.475
So, now I can just run this with yumex,

18
00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:27.365
and it's going to tell me I need to give the root password

19
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:34.560
because it has the ability to install and remove, et cetera, packages.

20
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.480
Now, you see it's listing updates that the system needs.

21
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.435
I haven't run "yum update" on the system for a while,

22
00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:47.200
I can click on Install Packages.

23
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.750
So, it's looking at generating a list of

24
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.690
all the packages which are installed on the system.

25
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.960
If I were to check one of them, let's say ImageMagick,

26
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.040
that would be implying that the change I want to make is to remove it.

27
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.350
Likewise, if I go to Available,

28
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.880
let's pick something we haven't gotten already installed and, of course,

29
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.550
it's inquiring from the repos all the stuff that's available that we haven't installed,

30
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.375
so it takes a little time.

31
00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.995
We'll just pick something at random.

32
00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.355
Let's pick this one, Agda.

33
00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:28.955
It's a computer language.

34
00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:33.765
Then if I go look at the "Apply" button down in the corner here,

35
00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:36.935
it's figuring out what it would like to do.

36
00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:41.505
It's telling me it would install Agda, then it would remove ImageMagick.

37
00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:47.260
Then, it'll have to install all these different packages here for Agda to work properly.

38
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.880
So, I'm not actually going to do this, but if I were to say okay,

39
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.450
then it would do this.

40
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.150
Notice I only looked at Available, and Installed and Updates.

41
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.515
I can also look at Categories, for instance,

42
00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:07.440
where it would list things by category or groups,

43
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.105
where it shows the different groups around the system.

44
00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:13.150
For instance, under Desktops,

45
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.955
if I expand that out,

46
00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:18.670
you'll see the different desktops available like GNOME, et cetera.

47
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.000
If I were to click on GNOME,

48
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.080
it would install everything needed for GNOME that it doesn't have already,

49
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.690
and if I click on KDE,

50
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.650
it would install the KDE desktop, et cetera.

51
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.605
So, let me get out of this.

52
00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:36.700
Next, I will show you a brief demonstration

53
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.850
on Fedora, which has a somewhat different setup.

54
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.685
So, now let's experiment with this on Fedora 25.

55
00:03:53.685 --> 00:03:58.915
Now, Fedora doesn't actually use yum anymore,

56
00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:02.815
it uses dnf, which is a modern replacement for it.

57
00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:06.490
So, it turns out yumex is no longer called yumex,

58
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.390
it's called yumex-dnf, which is not installed here,

59
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.390
so I just showed above there.

60
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.280
So, let's install it.

61
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:25.770
So, "sudo dnf install yumex-dnf".

62
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.490
That should go out and get that from its main repository.

63
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.725
We haven't done an update on the system for a little while, so it has

64
00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:44.860
to download all the repo information, which unfortunately takes a little bit of time.

65
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.090
But it's doing that. You'll see the interface on Fedora,

66
00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.650
the graphical user application has a newer interface with some more capabilities,

67
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.600
probably a more pleasant look if you tend that way,

68
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.660
and that's typical, Fedora's development version

69
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.860
of Red Hat and CentOS is based on Red Hat,

70
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.360
so that's a pretty common situation.

71
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.310
We're just waiting for it to actually get the information about installing.

72
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.195
Okay, so it's getting more repo information,

73
00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:38.895
this one from a smaller repo: the Updates repo.

74
00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:40.490
It's seeing whether or not there's

75
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.900
actually a newer version than what's in the original repo.

76
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.180
Okay. So, it's not very big,

77
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.930
it's just 1.3 megabytes,

78
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.735
but it needs once again to install some Python packages.

79
00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.540
So, now it's installed,

80
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.770
so let's run "yumex-dnf".

81
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.370
You notice on Fedora

82
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.040
it didn't ask me for a password,

83
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.840
but I'm sure it would if I actually try to remove or install anything.

84
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.200
So, while it looks different,

85
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.600
the information's basically the same.

86
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.785
So, here, we're in Updates.

87
00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:36.060
Once again, I can click on something like ImageMagick in Installed,

88
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.980
and then, under Available,

89
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.525
I can click on something like NetworkManager-bluetooth,

90
00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:49.240
or, in fact, let's go to the same thing we did on the other machine if it's there,

91
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.550
I don't see it actually.

92
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.190
Oh, there it is. Okay, set language again.

93
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.965
The question is where's the Apply button?

94
00:07:06.965 --> 00:07:09.020
Oh, I have to click on Queue.

95
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.295
Okay, there is no Apply button.

96
00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:13.185
If I click on Queue,

97
00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:22.860
it's telling me what it would like to do and see more details.

98
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.340
It's not as obvious what I have to click on to make the operations complete,

99
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.680
but in this box here,

100
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.750
I can click on "Apply pending actions" and it's going to ask me to do the same things.

101
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.470
Okay? I don't want to remove Emacs,

102
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.345
so I don't really want to play with this,

103
00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:53.340
but I will just hit "Cancel", but if I were to hit "OK",

104
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.230
it would ask me for a password.

105
00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.180
So, you see Fedora is essentially the same, except yum has become dnf,

106
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.750
and it has a somewhat newer GUI than it did on CentOS.
