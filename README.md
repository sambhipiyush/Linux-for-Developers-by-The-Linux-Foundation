# Linux for Developers by The Linux Foundation

#### Instructor(s) : Jerry Cooperstein

## About this Course
In course 1 we talked about open source software and the motivation and methods of using it. In course 2, we will introduce you to Linux systems, and help you feel comfortable working at the command line:

#### What Linux is
1. Linux history
1. How to separate the kernel from the entire operating system
1. Making contributions to the kernel
1. Graphical system, and how it works
1. Working at the command line
1. Filesystem layout, partitions
1. Monitoring utilities

> You will learn what it’s like to work on Linux system, and get a good understanding of the essential skills you need when you work on a daily basis with Linux systems.

* Explain the difference between the Linux kernel and the full Operating System (OS)
* Summarize the history of Linux and its relationship to UNIX
* Describe the role of Linux distributions and the Linux Standard Base (LSB)
* Enumerate the various layers that must be traversed to bring a system up to a full graphical desktop
* Understand the use of the X Window system and the roles of and choices for window and desktop managers
* Access terminal windows for command line work and deployment choices
* Access documentation and help resources for Linux systems, including man, info, help, and the --help option

### WEEK 2

#### STARTING TO WORK IN LINUX

##### Key Concepts

* List the main text editors available on virtually any Linux-based system, concentrating on vi, emcas, nano and gedit
* Understand how to use vi and emacs editors and how to create files with just cat and echo and no editor
* Discuss how the operating system employs command shells, the choices available, and how bash is initialized
* Explain the use of aliases, manipulate and use environment variables, and customize the command line prompt
* Discuss special characters, and understand how to use them, as well as to override their special meaning
* Use redirection for input, output, and error messages, and use command substitution to feed the output of one program to another
* Employ pipes to let connected programs run in parallel efficiently for better utilization of system resources
* Discuss the main directory structures used in Linux and their purposes
* Describe how partitions are used and how to construct, format, and manipulate them, and how to establish good partitioning schemes

##### Key Concepts

* Understand how the system boots, the role of GRUB and the contents of the /boot directory
* Discuss the next steps of launching essential functions using systemd and its predecessors, SysVinit and Upstart
* Kill the graphical desktop interface and enter a pure text-based terminal
* Analyze memory usage and the role of swap space, and how the system reacts to running out of memory
