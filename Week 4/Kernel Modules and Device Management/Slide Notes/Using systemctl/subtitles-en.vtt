00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.594
We're now going to get some practice starting and stopping,

2
00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:10.120
enabling and disabling services with systemd. There's

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.020
only one utility that we really need to use to do that, systemctl.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.110
This computer has two different hypervisors installed on the system.

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.670
The first one being VirtualBox from Oracle and the

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
second one being VMWare player from VMware.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.925
So, first, let me show that there are no currently

8
00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:36.450
any kernel modules loaded that come from either program.

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.795
So, if I do "lsmod",

10
00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:44.790
I don't see anything recognizable as coming from VirtualBox or VMware.

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.750
So, first, let's work with VirtualBox.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.860
I can do "sudo systemctl status vboxdrv"

13
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.185
vbox drive, and it shows it's not currently loaded, that it's inactive.

14
00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:13.965
So, let me start it, and then do the status again.

15
00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:18.560
And you see now it says that is currently running and

16
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.555
that it started the VirtualBox kernel module. If I do an "lsmod",

17
00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:29.910
indeed, you see those first four modules, they are associated with VirtualBox.

18
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.855
Once again, I can disable it,

19
00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:36.560
so let me do that with "sudo systemctl

20
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.265
stop vboxdrv".

21
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.175
This time I'm going to append ".service" to it, which a lot of

22
00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:51.535
documentation tells you you should generally do with most systemd services.

23
00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:54.750
Then, if I do the status again,

24
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.300
you'll see that it's currently not running.

25
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.910
For most things, you don't really need to add

26
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.260
the ".service" because there are some other possibilities that can go as extensions there,

27
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.340
but most of the time, you can omit it and things will be just fine.

28
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.850
Okay. So, now let's do the same exercise with VMware.

29
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.690
So, let me do "sudo

30
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.910
systemctl status vmware".

31
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.220
Okay. It says that it's not currently loaded

32
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.690
and you notice that it mentiones the "systemd-sysv-generator",

33
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.470
that's because VMware has not configured this on the system as a proper systemd service,

34
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.565
it's still set up basically as a SysVinit service,

35
00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.890
and so there's a compatibility layer that goes with

36
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.385
systemd that redirects the commands to more old-fashion System V commands.

37
00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:01.000
If I want to start the service,

38
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.515
and I can just do that once again with start.

39
00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:09.575
Then, if I do lsmod, now,

40
00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:14.045
you'll see there's several modules associated with VMWare,

41
00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:17.945
also four modules, actually five modules in this case.

42
00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:23.470
If I do a status command again,

43
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.285
it tells you quite a bit about what's actually running.

44
00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:36.940
Then, I can stop it and do the status command again,

45
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.100
and it shows that this query had been stop.

46
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.200
Now, in either case,

47
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.990
I can set it up so that the services start when the system is loaded,

48
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.890
so that I have either VMWare,

49
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.450
VirtualBox always available to me without having to manually start it,

50
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.370
and I would do that with "sudo systemctl

51
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:09.530
enable vmware", and I can do the same thing with vboxdrv.

52
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.600
You'll notice, with VMware,

53
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.170
it says it rerouted it to /sbin/chkconfig. That shows chkconfig,

54
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.350
which shows you that compatibility layer.

55
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.190
But it didn't actually start either one of them.

56
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.400
If I do lsmod,

57
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.080
you see the modules are not loaded,

58
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.955
but next time I boot, they will all be loaded.

59
00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:34.095
Now, I don't recommend you run both of these programs at the same time.

60
00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:38.290
They do similar things with the Linux kernel and they can get in each other's way,

61
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.000
so you should disable at least one of them.

62
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.910
So, I will disable VirtualBox.

63
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.655
So, do "sudo disable vboxdrv" and then,

64
00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:53.185
I forgot to say systemctl.

65
00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.165
Then, next time the system starts,

66
00:04:55.165 --> 00:04:57.530
it will only start VMware.
