00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.486
We will now demonstrate how you can use GRUB to pick different operating systems,

2
00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:12.784
kernels, or specify kernel command line parameters to boot your system with.

3
00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:20.119
So, let's start up a CentOS 7 virtual machine using VMWare.

4
00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:31.128
Okay, and we can pick at the GRUB screen which kernel we want to start.

5
00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:33.005
I will pick this third one here.

6
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:38.643
And if I would just to hit "Return", it would start up normally and running that kernel.

7
00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:43.654
I would like to do something a little more ambitious, so I'll hit "e" for edit,

8
00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:48.273
and then I'll scroll down to what we call the kernel command line, and

9
00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:53.237
that's the one that starts with Linux 16 here, and I'll do two things.

10
00:00:53.237 --> 00:00:57.370
At the end of the kernel command line, I'll append the 3.

11
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.866
Which means go to runlevel three or pure text and no graphical login screen.

12
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:11.020
And then I'll also comment out the words here quiet.

13
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.120
That means it will show all the kernel boot messages instead

14
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.060
of just some nice little graphical screen when it boots.

15
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.064
Which I can also disable by commenting out the previous parameter,

16
00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:27.502
RGB, which is also for graphical interface.

17
00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:30.314
And then I'll hit Ctrl-x to start,

18
00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:33.903
as it says in the help messages at the bottom here.

19
00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:36.490
And so now this system is starting,

20
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.330
you're seeing every single message that happens when it starts.

21
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.667
And I will go to a pure virtual terminal or command line login screen.

22
00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.602
You see it's taken about 8 seconds so

23
00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:56.186
far to get here, 13 seconds now to get the final part, and

24
00:01:56.186 --> 00:02:01.250
now I'm at a boot screen, so I'll say "coop", I'm sorry, "student".

25
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.752
And I'll give the "student" password.

26
00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:07.618
And we're fully up and normally running.

27
00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:13.785
Now, if I wanted to start the graphical console, I'll use a command

28
00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:18.568
we'll discuss in the next section, I say "sudo

29
00:02:18.568 --> 00:02:24.125
systemctl start gdm", which is the GNOME display manager.

30
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:29.783
So, I'm going to start that up and that will bring up a graphical login screen.

31
00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.046
And there we go.

32
00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:34.822
And I could type in my username and password and I'll be going.

33
00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:39.977
So that's how you use GRUB to control your booting procedure.
